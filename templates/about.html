    Avant-garde art's plasticity is the plasticity of reality itself
  </h2>
  <p class="text-center">
    The avant-garde movements of the early 20th century present a world where
    art defies convention and philosophy reshapes perception. This blog examines
    how Cubism, Surrealism, and other revolutionary styles engaged with ideas
    such as plasticity, speculation, and the absolute. Forms bend, dissolve, and
    reconstruct, reflecting philosophical explorations of reality’s malleable
    nature. The speculative impulse behind this engagement with reality drove
    artists to envision worlds beyond the tangible, and the quest for the
    absolute that tethered creative chaos to transcendental ideals. A journey
    through art as thought — provocative, fluid, and infinitely transformative.
